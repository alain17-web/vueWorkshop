Workshop in Vue.js

After a presentation of the theory on how Vue.js works, the workshop will include the live coding of two small and very simple applications that we hope will help you grasp the possibilities that Vue has to offer.

# Vue3 Basic 
is a small app in the recently released Vue 3 version that will show wether or not a article is in stock and that gives the user the opportunity to leave a review through a form. It's aimed at illustrating how the main Vue directives are used. As it is a small project, we'll use a CDN to load Vue.

# Real World Vue 
is a slightly more complex and realistic app that calls an API to display a list of cards showing different events. We will use among other things NPM, single file components and Axios.
