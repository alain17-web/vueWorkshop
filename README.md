# vueWorkshop
Workshop in Vue.js

After a presentation of the theory on how Vue.js works, the workshop will include the live coding of two small and very simple applications that we hope will you grasp the possibilities that Vue has to offer.

# Vue3 Basic 
is a small app in the recently released Vue 3 version that will show wether or not a article is in stock and that gives the user the opportunity to leave a review through a form. It's aimed at illustrating how the main Vue directives are used.
